          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Walter Alfaro</strong>. Welcome to this website, where we explore the serious issue of verbal abuse. Verbal abuse may not leave physical marks, but its emotional scars are often deep and lasting. It can take many forms: harsh words, insults, manipulation, and constant criticism. These behaviors can slowly wear down a person's self-esteem, mental well-being, and overall happiness.</p>
  
          <p>Verbal abuse doesn’t just happen in homes or personal relationships—it can occur in the workplace, at school, or even in public spaces. Those subjected to this form of abuse may experience significant mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and chronic stress. While the abuser may see their words as 'just joking' or not important, for the victim, they can have long-term effects on their emotional and physical health.</p>
  
          <p>Throughout this website, you will find information on the mental and physical impacts of verbal abuse, how to recognize it, and what steps you can take to either prevent it or seek help if you or someone you know is affected. The aim is to raise awareness of verbal abuse and its consequences so that we can foster more supportive and healthy environments for everyone.</p>
  
          <p>Let’s raise awareness and work together towards a future where verbal abuse is no longer tolerated, and where those affected can find the support they need to recover and thrive.</p>
