            <h2>My Personal Experience with Verbal Abuse</h2>
            <p>This is my personal story about how verbal abuse affected my life and how I learned to overcome it.</p>

            <h3>The Early Signs</h3>
            <p>Looking back, I can now see the early signs of verbal abuse that I didn’t recognize at first. It began with subtle remarks—criticism that felt more like teasing. Over time, these words chipped away at my confidence and self-worth. I often found myself questioning my own abilities and feeling inadequate, even though I hadn’t done anything wrong. But it wasn’t until much later that I understood the full extent of the damage.</p>

            <h3>The Impact on Mental Health</h3>
            <p>The constant barrage of negative words eventually took a toll on my mental health. I started to feel anxious and developed a persistent sense of self-doubt. The words replayed in my mind over and over again, making it hard to focus on anything else. There were days when I didn’t want to interact with anyone, and it became harder to engage in things I once enjoyed.</p>

            <h3>Physical Symptoms</h3>
            <p>While the effects of verbal abuse are often emotional, they can also manifest physically. I began to experience chronic headaches, insomnia, and even stomach issues, which I later realized were linked to the stress and anxiety caused by the abuse. These symptoms became a constant reminder of the pain I was going through.</p>

            <h3>Seeking Help</h3>
            <p>Eventually, I reached a breaking point. I knew I couldn’t go on living this way, and I decided to seek help. Talking to school counselor helped me understand that what I was experiencing was not my fault. With time, I began to rebuild my confidence, set boundaries, and heal from the emotional wounds caused by verbal abuse.</p>

            <h3>Healing and Moving Forward</h3>
            <p>Recovery wasn’t easy, and it’s still something I work on every day. But with the support of loved ones and professionals, I’ve been able to regain control of my life. I’ve learned that my self-worth is not defined by the hurtful words of others. My hope is that by sharing my story, I can help others recognize the signs of verbal abuse and encourage them to seek the help they need.</p>

            <p><em>Remember, you are not alone, and there is always help available for those who need it.</em></p>
